     * The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
     * You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.
     * You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e.,
     * you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
     * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
     * Ex: Fruit = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C'}
     * result = 3 {C, A, C}
